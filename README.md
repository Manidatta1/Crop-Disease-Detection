Crop Disease Prediction is an application of Deep learning, where it predicts the disease of the Crop and suggests the best medicine to cure the disease. Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. Plant diseases are one of major reasons behind the production and economic losses in agriculture.
The neural networks have been an emerging application in numerous and diverse areas as examples of end to end learning. The nodes in a neural network are mathematical functions that take numerical inputs from the incoming edges and provide a numerical output as an outgoing edge.
The combination of Deep learning and recent advances in computer vision has paved the way for Crop disease diagnosis. 
Neural networks provide a mapping between an input such as an image of a diseased plant to an output such as a crop disease pair. 
To develop such a precise image classifier aimed at diagnosis of diseases of plant, we need a large, processed and verified dataset containing various diseased and healthy plant images.

# Crop Disease Detection Model

## Overview

This project aims to detect crop diseases using a machine learning model implemented on a Raspberry Pi. The model is built using the VGG19 architecture and trained on a dataset containing images of various crop diseases.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with camera module
- Python 3
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the provided Python script (`Crop_disease_prediction (1).py`) to capture an image.
3. The captured image will be processed by the trained model, and the predicted disease will be displayed as output.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-disease-detection.git
cd crop-disease-detection
